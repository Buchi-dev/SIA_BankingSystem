# Wired City Banking System Project Plan (Wiki)

## 1. Project Overview
The Wired City Banking System is designed to serve as the financial backbone of a smart, interconnected city. It enables seamless transactions between the bank and various external systems (such as fast food restaurants, retail stores, and service providers) through secure APIs. The system is built with a focus on security, scalability, and transparency, using MySQL as the backend database.

## 2. System Architecture
- **Core Banking System:** Handles user management, account management, and transaction processing.
- **External System Integration:** Provides APIs for third-party systems to connect and transact (e.g., payments, balance inquiries).
- **Security & Authentication:** Implements robust authentication (JWT for users/admins, API keys for external systems) and role-based access control.
- **Transaction Logging & Auditing:** All activities are logged for transparency and compliance.
- **Dashboard & Analytics:** Admin dashboard for monitoring system health, transactions, and analytics.
- **Database:** MySQL is used for reliable, relational data storage.

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering
- Identify all user roles: admin, customer, external system.
- List all features and use cases (e.g., user registration, account creation, external payments).
- Gather requirements for security, scalability, and compliance.

### Step 2: System Design
- Design the database schema (tables for users, accounts, transactions, external systems).
- Create detailed API specifications for both internal and external endpoints.
- Plan security architecture (authentication, authorization, encryption).
- Design system architecture diagrams (ERD, sequence diagrams, integration flowcharts).

### Step 3: Environment Setup
- Choose technology stack (Node.js/Express, Python/Django, etc.).
- Set up development environment (IDE, version control with Git, dependency management).
- Initialize project repository and configure MySQL database.

### Step 4: Core Banking System Development
- Implement user registration, login, and profile management.
- Develop account management (CRUD operations for accounts).
- Implement transaction processing (deposit, withdraw, transfer) with validation and error handling.
- Ensure all actions are logged for auditing.

### Step 5: External System Integration
- Develop secure APIs for external systems (register, payment, balance inquiry).
- Implement API key management and validation for external systems.
- Provide sample integration guides and test endpoints for third-party developers.

### Step 6: Security Implementation
- Secure all API endpoints with authentication and authorization middleware.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types.
- Use HTTPS for all communications and encrypt sensitive data in the database.

### Step 7: Transaction Logging & Auditing
- Log all transactions, API calls, and critical actions with timestamps and user/system IDs.
- Implement audit trails for compliance and troubleshooting.
- Provide admin tools for viewing and exporting logs.

### Step 8: Dashboard & Analytics
- Build an admin dashboard to monitor transactions, system health, and external integrations.
- Add analytics for transaction trends, user activity, and system usage.
- Provide visualizations (charts, graphs) for key metrics.

### Step 9: Testing
- Write unit tests for all models, controllers, and utility functions.
- Perform integration testing with mock external systems.
- Conduct security and performance testing (e.g., penetration testing, load testing).

### Step 10: Documentation
- Document all API endpoints (internal and external) with request/response examples.
- Write user guides for customers and admin guides for staff.
- Provide integration documentation for external partners.

### Step 11: Deployment
- Deploy the system to a test/staging environment for QA.
- Prepare deployment scripts and environment variables for production.
- Set up monitoring and alerting for production systems.

### Step 12: Presentation
- Prepare a project presentation with system architecture, features, and demo scenarios.
- Create demo scripts and sample data for live demonstrations.

## 4. Example Use Case
A customer pays at a fast food restaurant. The restaurant’s system sends a payment request to the bank’s API. The bank processes the transaction, updates both the customer’s and restaurant’s accounts, and returns the result to the restaurant’s system. All actions are logged for auditing.

## 5. Glossary
- **API:** Application Programming Interface, allows systems to communicate.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Token, used for secure authentication.
- **RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control, restricts system access based on user roles.
- **CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for managing data.
- **Audit Trail:** Record of all system activities for compliance and troubleshooting.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system used for data storage.
